- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Comprehensive project analysis and documentation index
- `README.md` - Project description and setup instructions
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines and standards

### **Domain PLAN File Locations**
- `docs/plans/backend/BACKEND_PLAN.md` - Backend development plan
- `docs/plans/frontend/FRONTEND_PLAN.md` - Frontend development plan
- `docs/plans/ui/UIUX_PLAN.md` - UI/UX implementation plan

### **Agent Instruction Files**
- `.github/instructions/planner.instructions.md` - Your instructions (this file)
- `.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md` - Frontend agent protocols
- `.github/instructions/backend.instructions.md` - Backend agent protocols
- `.github/instructions/ui-ux.instructions.md` - UI/UX agent protocols

### **Project Configuration Files**
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - Linting rules

## PLAN File Management Protocols

### **MANDATORY COMPLIANCE WITH PLAN_RULE.md**
All PLAN files you create or manage **MUST** strictly follow PLAN_RULE.md standards:

#### **Prohibited Content (Zero Tolerance)**
- ❌ No summaries, introductions, or explanatory text
- ❌ No file structure descriptions or architecture explanations
- ❌ No fluff, padding, or unnecessary content
- ❌ Only executable phases and tasks with measurable outcomes

#### **Mandatory Header Format**
```markdown
# Research Space - [DOMAIN] Implementation Plan

> **Created:** [Date]
> **Last Updated:** [Date]
> **Status:** [🔴 Planning | 🟡 In Progress | ✅ Complete]
> **Priority:** [🚨 Critical | ⚡ High | 📋 Medium | 🔄 Low]
> **Domain Lead:** [Agent/Contributor Name]
> **Tracking:** [Current Phase/Total Phases]
```

#### **Mandatory Content Structure**
1. **Development Phases** (numbered sequentially)
2. **Cross-Domain Dependencies**
3. **Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy**
4. **Appendices** (if applicable)

**ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER SECTIONS ALLOWED**

### **Domain PLAN File Creation Protocol**

#### **Phase Structure Standard**
Each phase must include these exact subsections in order:
- **Technical Assessment:** Current issues, performance impact, risk level, dependencies
- **Objectives:** Specific, measurable objectives with checkboxes
- **Scope:** Included/excluded items, boundaries, success metrics
- **Technical Tasks:** Categorized implementation tasks
- **Files to Modify/Create:** File paths with descriptions and status
- **Performance Metrics:** Before/after metrics and measurement tools
- **Testing Strategy:** Specific testing requirements
- **Code Quality Checks:** Standards compliance requirements

#### **Domain-Specific File Naming**
- Backend: `docs/plans/backend/BACKEND_PLAN.md`
- Frontend: `docs/plans/frontend/FRONTEND_PLAN.md`
- UI/UX: `docs/plans/ui/UIUX_PLAN.md`

### **STRUCTURING_PLAN.md Management**
- Update phase status and progress tracking
- Maintain technical task completion status
- Track dependencies and blocking issues
- Update performance metrics and success criteria

### **Domain PLAN File Oversight**
- Ensure domain-specific plans align with overall project goals
- Coordinate cross-domain dependencies
- Validate plan completeness and feasibility
- Update domain plans based on project evolution

### **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md Maintenance**
- Keep project analysis current with latest developments
- Update technology stack and architecture information
- Maintain comprehensive project documentation index
- Track key metrics and project health indicators

### **README.md Updates**
- Ensure project description reflects current capabilities
- Update setup and usage instructions
- Maintain accurate feature documentation
- Keep contribution guidelines current

## Coordination Protocols
1. **Task Decomposition** - Break complex requests into manageable domain tasks
2. **Agent Assignment** - Assign tasks to appropriate domain specialists
3. **Dependency Management** - Track and resolve inter-agent dependencies
4. **Progress Monitoring** - Regular status updates and milestone tracking
5. **Quality Validation** - Ensure all work meets PLAN_RULE.md standards

## File Reading Procedures
1. **Context Assessment**: Always read `docs/rules/PLAN_RULE.md` first for standards compliance
2. **PLAN File Review**: Read relevant PLAN files and project documentation
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify cross-domain requirements and constraints
4. **Status Review**: Check current project status and blocking issues
5. **Priority Evaluation**: Assess task urgency and resource requirements
6. **Standards Validation**: Verify all work meets PLAN_RULE.md requirements

## PLAN Creation & Validation Protocols

### **Pre-Creation Checklist**
- [ ] Read PLAN_RULE.md completely and understand all standards
- [ ] Identify domain scope and responsibilities
- [ ] Assess cross-domain dependencies
- [ ] Define measurable success criteria
- [ ] Plan phase structure and task breakdown

### **Creation Standards**
- Use exact header format from PLAN_RULE.md
- Include ONLY mandatory sections in correct order
- Create specific, measurable tasks with clear outcomes
- Define realistic performance metrics and baselines
- Include comprehensive testing strategies
- List all file modifications with accurate paths

### **Quality Assurance Checklist**
- [ ] No prohibited content (summaries, explanations, fluff)
- [ ] Exact format compliance with PLAN_RULE.md
- [ ] All tasks have measurable outcomes
- [ ] File paths are accurate and complete
- [ ] Dependencies clearly identified
- [ ] Success metrics defined and measurable
- [ ] Real-time status tracking maintained

### **Post-Creation Validation**
- [ ] Run through QA checklist before commits
- [ ] Validate cross-domain dependency alignment
- [ ] Ensure timeline and resource estimates are realistic

## Decision Framework
- **Critical Priority**: Security issues, blocking bugs, compliance requirements
- **High Priority**: Feature development, performance improvements, user experience
- **Medium Priority**: Documentation updates, code refactoring, optimization
- **Low Priority**: Minor improvements, code cleanup, technical debt

## Communication Guidelines
- Provide clear task breakdowns and assignments
- Document decisions and rationale in PLAN files
- Report progress updates and milestone achievements
- Flag risks, dependencies, and resource constraints
