#### **Step 1: Frontend Agent - Phase 1**
**Agent:** Frontend Developer Agent  
**Phase:** Library Page Advanced UI Components (Google Drive Experience)  
**Dependencies:** None - Can start immediately  
**Duration:** ~2-3 days  
**Status:** 🔴 Ready to Start

**Prompt:**
```
Frontend Agent: Please implement Phase 1 from FRONTEND_PLAN.md v1.2:
"Library Page Advanced UI Components (Google Drive Experience)"

Focus on:

2. Create FileCard and FolderCard components with mock data
3. Implement nested folder navigation with breadcrumbs
4. Build multi-select checkbox system
5. Add rename modal and context menus
6. Create global drop zone component

Use mock data for now - no backend integration required.

## 🔄 **Parallel Work Opportunities**

### **Parallel Window 1: Frontend Phase 1 + Backend Phase 1**
```
Timeline Day 1-4:
├─ Frontend Agent: Working on UI components (Phase 1)
└─ Backend Agent: Working on S3 configuration API (Phase 1)

Coordination: 
- Day 2: Backend shares API design with Frontend for review
- Day 4: Both phases complete independently
```

### **Parallel Window 2: Frontend Phase 3 + Backend Phase 2**
```
Timeline Day 5-8:
├─ Frontend Agent: Working on Connections UI (Phase 3)
└─ Backend Agent: Working on file operations API (Phase 2)

Coordination:
- Day 6: Backend shares file API design with Frontend
- Day 8: Backend Phase 2 completes
- Day 9: Frontend Phase 3 completes and validates Backend Phase 2
```

---

## ⚠️ **Critical Blocking Dependencies**

### **🔴 HARD BLOCKS (Cannot Proceed Until Resolved):**

1. **Frontend Phase 3 → Backend Phase 1**
   - Frontend CANNOT start Phase 3 until Backend Phase 1 is complete
   - Reason: Requires working API endpoints for configuration

2. **Frontend Phase 5 → Backend Phase 2**
   - Frontend CANNOT start Phase 5 until Backend Phase 2 is complete
   - Reason: Requires working file operation APIs

### **🟡 SOFT DEPENDENCIES (Can Start, But Need Coordination):**

1. **Backend Phase 1 → Frontend Phase 1**
   - Backend can start Phase 1 during Frontend Phase 1
   - Coordination: Backend should review Frontend UI at ~50% for API design validation

2. **Backend Phase 2 → Frontend Phase 3**
   - Backend can start Phase 2 when Frontend Phase 3 is ~50% complete
   - Coordination: Backend should provide API documentation for Frontend Phase 5

## 📊 **Execution Timeline (Estimated)**

```
Week 1:
├─ Day 1-3: Frontend Phase 1 (UI Components)
├─ Day 2-4: Backend Phase 1 (S3 Config API) [Parallel]
└─ Day 5-6: Frontend Phase 3 (Connections UI) [After Backend Phase 1]
