## 🎯 **MinIO Configuration Guidance**

Based on your screenshot, here are the **recommended settings** for the `research-space-library` bucket:

### **✅ ENABLE These Features:**

#### **1. Versioning: ON** ✅
- **Why:** Maintains version history of all research files
- **Benefit:** Enables recovery from accidental deletions or overwrites
- **Backend Support:** Already planned in architecture
- **Impact:** Critical for research data integrity

#### **2. Object Locking: ON** ✅
- **Why:** Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) protection
- **Benefit:** Prevents accidental or malicious deletion
- **Mode:** **Compliance** (stricter than Governance)
- **Impact:** Required for retention policies
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Must be enabled at bucket creation (cannot enable later)

#### **3. Retention: ON** ✅
- **Mode:** **Compliance**
- **Duration:** **30 days** (as shown in your screenshot)
- **Why:** Enforces minimum retention period
- **Benefit:** Prevents deletion within first 30 days
- **Future:** Can be extended per-object or globally later

### **❌ DISABLE This Feature:**

#### **4. Quota: OFF** ❌
- **Why:** Unknown storage requirements during testing
- **Benefit:** No artificial limits during development
- **Future:** Enable after understanding usage patterns
- **Impact:** Can be added later based on actual needs

## 🔐 **Next Steps: Configure MinIO Connection**

### **Step 1: Complete Bucket Creation**

In MinIO Console:
1. ✅ Bucket Name: `research-space-library`
2. ✅ Versioning: **ON**
3. ✅ Object Locking: **ON**
4. ✅ Retention Mode: **Compliance**
5. ✅ Retention Validity: **30 days**
6. ❌ Quota: **OFF**
7. Click **"Create Bucket"**

### **Step 2: Create Access Key**

In MinIO Console → Access Keys:
1. Click "Create New Access Key"
2. Save the **Access Key ID**
3. Save the **Secret Access Key**
4. Ensure key has `s3:*` permissions on `research-space-library` bucket

### **Step 3: Test Connection via UI**

1. Start backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Backend runs at http://localhost:3001
```

2. Start frontend:
```bash
cd .. # back to root
npm run dev
# Frontend runs at http://localhost:5173
```

3. Navigate to Connections Page:
```
http://localhost:5173/connections
```

4. Fill in the form:
```
Provider: MinIO
Endpoint: http://localhost:9000
Access Key: <your-access-key>
Secret Key: <your-secret-key>
Region: us-east-1
Bucket Name: research-space-library
```

5. Click **"Test Connection"**

6. Wait for success message:
```
✅ Connection test successful!
Provider: MinIO
Bucket: research-space-library
Versioning: Enabled
Response Time: ~1.8s
```

### **Step 4: Save Configuration**

1. After successful test, click **"Save Configuration"**
2. Read the lock warning modal:
```
⚠️ Configuration Lock Warning

Once you save this configuration, the storage provider, 
endpoint, and bucket cannot be changed. This prevents 
accidental data loss and ensures consistency.

Are you sure you want to proceed?
```
3. Click **"Confirm and Lock"**
4. Verify lock status appears:
```
🔒 Configuration Locked
Provider: MinIO
Bucket: research-space-library
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Configuration Lock:**
Once you save the MinIO configuration via the Connections Page:
- ❌ **Cannot change provider** (MinIO → S3 blocked)
- ❌ **Cannot change endpoint** (http://localhost:9000 locked)
- ❌ **Cannot change bucket** (research-space-library locked)
- ✅ **Can change credentials** (for key rotation)

### **Why Lock Exists:**
1. Prevents accidental data loss from provider switching
2. Ensures file metadata consistency
3. Avoids orphaned files in multiple storage systems
4. Simplifies backend architecture

### **Admin Override:**
If you need to unlock (for testing):
- Use admin endpoint: `POST /api/storage/unlock`
- Requires admin authentication token
- Documented in backend/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md
