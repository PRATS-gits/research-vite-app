## ⚠️ **Critical Blocking Dependencies**

### **🔴 HARD BLOCKS (Cannot Proceed Until Resolved):**

1. **Frontend Phase 3 → Backend Phase 1**
   - Frontend CANNOT start Phase 3 until Backend Phase 1 is complete
   - Reason: Requires working API endpoints for configuration

2. **Frontend Phase 5 → Backend Phase 2**
   - Frontend CANNOT start Phase 5 until Backend Phase 2 is complete
   - Reason: Requires working file operation APIs

### **🟡 SOFT DEPENDENCIES (Can Start, But Need Coordination):**

1. **Backend Phase 1 → Frontend Phase 1**
   - Backend can start Phase 1 during Frontend Phase 1
   - Coordination: Backend should review Frontend UI at ~50% for API design validation

2. **Backend Phase 2 → Frontend Phase 3**
   - Backend can start Phase 2 when Frontend Phase 3 is ~50% complete
   - Coordination: Backend should provide API documentation for Frontend Phase 5
