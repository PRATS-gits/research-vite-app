1) The file or folder gets selected in a single click. Which pops up the options to (Preview, Rename, Export and Delete). The file or folder should be get selected when the small checkbox is clicked on them which is positioned on the top-left of the card. This checkbox isn't visible by default, so this causes the inconsistency.
2) The file or folder should open when the user double clicks on them. 
3) The file which is a PDF should open a preview in new tab just like Google Drive with a presigned URL since we'll expose it to end user. The current functionality downloads the PDF instead of previewing it. Since we've the URL the same browser can be used to preview PDF with that browser's built in PDF rendering and access tools comforting users needs.
4) The share link functionality doesn't work if we want to give access or share via the presigned URL, the option does appear on screen but it abruptly closes without giving user the presigned URL that needs to be shared. Please check that functionality and how its implemented via Backend Agent (backend) folder.
5) The Preview buttons are mismatched. The Preview functionality which is attached to the Preview button which appears when the file gets selected, the same functionality is not attached to the Preview option which appears in the Context Menu when the file is right-clicked.
6) The Open and Move To options from the Context Menu doesn't work. When clicked on any folder it doesn't open and when any file or folder is right-clicked to move to specific folders in library it also don't work.
7) Finally every modal which opens up closes instantly when user clicks on any part of the screen. Please make sure that the modal only closes when the user clicks the "Close Button" which is there in the modal. Also check if any essential modals are missing "Close Button", so this would give us an insight on modifying them as well.
