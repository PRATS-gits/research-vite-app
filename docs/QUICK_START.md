## üìä Execution Flow:

```
START ‚Üí Frontend Phase 1 (2-3 days)
         ‚Üì (parallel at 50%)
         Backend Phase 1 (3-4 days)
         ‚Üì (wait for complete)
         Frontend Phase 3 (2 days)
         ‚Üì (parallel at 50%)
         Backend Phase 2 (4-5 days)
         ‚Üì (wait for complete)
         Frontend Phase 5 (3-4 days) ‚Üí COMPLETE ‚úÖ
```

**Total Time: ~13 days with parallel work**

## üî¥ Critical Rules:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST WAIT** for Backend Phase 1 before starting Frontend Phase 3
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST WAIT** for Backend Phase 2 before starting Frontend Phase 5
- ‚úÖ Can run Backend Phase 1 parallel with Frontend Phase 1
