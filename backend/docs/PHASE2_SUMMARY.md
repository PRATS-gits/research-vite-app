## 🧪 Testing Results

### Endpoint Tests
✅ **Files List:** Returns empty array initially  
✅ **Folder Creation:** Successfully creates folder with UUID  
✅ **Root Contents:** Returns folder tree and breadcrumb  
✅ **TypeScript Build:** Zero compilation errors  
✅ **Server Start:** Runs on port 3001  

### Example Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "49c2a3fc-e2e9-43c2-a885-870934e0b40f",
    "name": "Test Folder",
    "path": "/Test Folder",
    "parentId": null
